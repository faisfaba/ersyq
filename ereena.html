<h1> from islam to ereena</h1>


<p>
assalamualaikum ereena,
 
  how are you? I hope you are doing well, what about your family? 
jk i will not be doing all that.. i know using a website to write a birthday message is a bit funky but i’ll just get straight to the point, Sanah Helwah ya ukhti 🥳 May Allah bless you always and accept your prayers InshaAllah. May Allah provide you and your family with happiness and rizq. as you know i’m not good at writing these long paragraphs like you are 😅 thank you so much for being a good friend to me, i know thank you is not enough cause you’ve done so much for me and you deserve way more, but thank you for being a kind, understanding, mature, and well-spoken friend. </p>

  <p>i pray that Allah benefits your experience at uni and provide you with علم. please take care of yourself and study well. i’ll pray that you become successful in this world and in the akhirah InshaAllah !! i hope you don’t feel insecure about yourself, because Allah has created us exactly that way, and his creations have no flaws. i’m sorry if i’ve ever hurt you with my words, please advice me if i do anything wrong.. kalau u rasa macam i ada tersalah cakap or something, you can always tell me. i know it's difficult to advice friends or relatives cause we fear they might be offended, tapi i tak nak macam tu, so just say anything you need to. as you know i’ve been reading this book titled “Destination Jannah”, and one of the topics explain how the people you are close to or your friends, can be roadblocks to Jannah, but Alhamdulillah that’s not the case with you.. i’m so grateful to be your friend. this time i probably won’t be able to gift you anything since it’s gonna be difficult for us to meet and i don’t even have anything to give so just consider this as.. a small gift 👍🏼</p>

  <p> remember when we used to call each other abah and dik 💀 sorry for suddenly bringing that up HAHAHAHAHA. i was reading our old convos on whatsapp…. that app is cursed, but there’s a lot of good memories. i literally cleared most of the media on our whatsapp chat cause it was taking sm storage so idek what’s going on at times when i read most convos.. kelakar la kita.. and the stickers.. allahuakbar 😭 also i tengah baca the birthday message from you when i was ignored for the whole day.. sumpah kelakar la u ni. i’ve literally scrolled for like a few seconds now, what in the world did we talk about on november 20, 2022?!?!?!? oh patut la 😭 takpe la tak nak scroll lagi…</p>

   <p>i’d say around 2 years ago, maybe 3.. when i started at tuition pro because your dad suggested it to mine, Allah swt gave me hidayah to start focusing on my studies, and my personal life instead of just doing nothing. in the process, i kinda got encouraged by u because i felt like i had competition… not in a bad way, but knowledge-wise. i felt like i was being left out.. i envy the fact that you memorised the quran, i just felt like you were a very knowledgable person(still is) and i wanted to be exactly that. i tak nak lah melebih sangat, Alhamdulillah all of this came from Allah swt, but i’m very grateful to be a friend of yours. </p>

  <p> i still remember what you wrote to me on my birthday, well a little... you said that friendships won't only provide us with sweet moments, but also the sour moments.. something like that and i know that sentence sounds funny but let it be hehe.. so i just wanna quote that and leave it here. i want you to know that you can always talk to me, even though i may sometimes type as if im not in the mood, but i'll always be here for you, got it? be good to your family ya, i pray that Allah provides you with an extended life n i also pray that your mom is well and healthy.. i hope you'll always prioritize taking care of your health before doing anything else, i hope we can keep advising each other if one of us does any wrong, i hope you won’t ever feel forced to reply to my annoying messages, i hope that whenever you talk to me you won’t feel the need to shut up because i don’t want you to, and lastly i hope nothing comes between our relationship till Jannah, InshaAllah. </p>
￼
<p> your annoyingly handsome friend islam loves you.</p>
